  "body": "The objective of this project is to create a really inexpensive internet enabled thermometer to be able to monitor a room's temperature remotely.\r\n\r\n# Main components\r\nHere what you're going to need:\r\n- ESP-01, a ESP8266 chip based WiFi module (others may also work with some modifications)\r\n- DS18S20 digital thermometer chip\r\n- 2xAA batteries or a 3V power adapter\r\n- FTDI or USB-to-Serial (3v3!) converter (for programming the ESP8266)\r\n- some cables, and a few discrete components (see the schematic)\r\n- lot of patience :)\r\n\r\n# General notes and caveats\r\nSome important things to watch out for\r\n\r\n# First steps\r\n[TBD: basic wiring, programming the ESP on 'breadboard' first\r\n\r\n# Building the thermometer\r\n## The circuit\r\n## The software\r\n\r\n# What else?\r\n[TBD: things to improve / try]\r\n\r\n# References and further reading\r\n\r\n",
