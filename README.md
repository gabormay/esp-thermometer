The objective of this project is to create a really inexpensive internet enabled thermometer to be able to monitor a room's temperature remotely.

# Main components
Here what you're going to need:
- ESP-01, a ESP8266 chip based WiFi module (others may also work with some modifications)
- DS18S20 digital thermometer chip
- 2xAA batteries or a 3V power adapter
- FTDI or USB-to-Serial (3v3!) converter (for programming the ESP8266)
- some cables, and a few discrete components (see the schematic)
- lot of patience :)

# General notes and caveats
- ESP8266 works with 3.3V, the pins are _not_ 5V tolerant!
- Use an external power supply for reliable programming (not the 3.3V from the USB converter for example)
- By now, there's extensive documentation is available for the ESP8266 and related stuff. If you're stuck or have an issue, pleaes  try looking through the materials in the [References] section and also try Google - chances are somebody else had that problem and you can find a solution quickly

# First steps

[TBD: basic wiring, programming the ESP on 'breadboard' first
