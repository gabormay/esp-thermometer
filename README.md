The objective of this project is to create a really inexpensive internet enabled thermometer to be able to monitor a room's temperature remotely.

# Main components
Here what you're going to need:
- ESP-01, a ESP8266 chip based WiFi module (others may also work with some modifications)
- DS18S20 digital thermometer chip
- 2xAA batteries or a 3V power adapter
- FTDI or USB-to-Serial (3v3!) converter (for programming the ESP8266)
- some cables, and a few discrete components (see the schematic)
- lot of patience :)

# General notes and caveats
Some important things to watch out for

# First steps
[TBD: basic wiring, programming the ESP on 'breadboard' first

# Building the thermometer
## The circuit
## The software

# Running from a battery

# What else?
[TBD: things to improve / try]
