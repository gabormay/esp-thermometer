The objective of this project is to create a really inexpensive internet enabled thermometer to be able to monitor a room's temperature remotely.

# Main components
Here's what you're going to need:
- ESP-01, a ESP8266 chip based WiFi module (others may also work with some modifications)
- DS18S20 digital thermometer chip (or compatible)
- 2xAA batteries or a 3V power adapter
- FTDI or USB-to-Serial (3v3!) converter (for programming the ESP8266)
- some cables, and a few discrete components (see the schematic)
- lot of patience :)

# General notes and caveats
- ESP8266 works with 3.3V, the pins are _not_ 5V tolerant!
- Use an external power supply for reliable programming (not the 3.3V from the USB converter for example)
- If you're stuck or have an issue with setting up the ESP8266, please  try looking through the materials in the [References](References and further reading) section and also try Google - chances are somebody else had that problem and you can find a solution quickly

# First steps - programming your ESP8266
Start with the installation steps from https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager:
- Install the Arduino IDE 
- Install the ESP8266 core library and select the board called 'Generic ESP8266 Module'

Wire up your ESP module on a breadboard as explained in https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/doc/boards.md#minimal-hardware-setup-for-bootloading-and-usage
- Use an external power source (do not use the USB-to-serial adapter's VCC)
- GND, TX and RX should be connected to the serial adapter's GND, RX and TX, respectively
- CH_PD (chip enable) should be connected the VCC (10k pull-up resistor recommended)
- RST and GPIO0 should be pulled-up to VCC
  * For convenience, add a switch or push button to be able to pull each down to GND momentarily
- Leave GPIO2 unconnected

Now load the Sketch from File/Examples/ESP8266/Blink
- Fill in your WiFi ssid and password
- 'Verify' should show no errors

Now you're ready to flash you first program to the ESP8266! Make sure that you have the Board setting in Arduino IDE set correctly:

  ![Board settings in Arduino IDE](img/Board settings.png)

Then put the ESP bootloader into programming mode:
- Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (Tools/Serial Monitor)
  * Choose the proper COM port
  * Choose 74880 baud (this is necessary in order to see bootloader messages properly)
- On the board, connect both `RST` and `GPIO0` to GND (push the buttons if you have added them)
- Release RST (connect back to VCC), while `GPIO0` is still at GND
- In the Serial Monitor you should see the following message from the bootloader:

    ```
     ets Jan  8 2013,rst cause:2, boot mode:(1,6)
    ```
    This means that the module is now in serial programming mode and ready to receive the new firmware.
- `GPIO0` can now be released back to VCC
- Select Sketch/Upload

In a short while the upload should finish without errors. If everything went fine the blue LED on the board will start blinking. You can now reset the board by connecting `RST` to GND momentarily. Make sure that `GPIO0` is _not_ connected to GND otherwise you will enter the programming mode again.

At this point I suggest you to play around with your ESP8266. Try changing the exampl or try other sketches. Look at the the list of functions in the [included libraries](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/doc/libraries.md) and try to use them in your program.

You can use `Serial.print()` family of functions to print diagnostic messages that you can then read in the Serial Monitor. Set the baud rate to 74880 to make it consistent with the bootloader via `Serial.begin(74880)`.

Once you feel comfortable programming your ESP8266, come back here and read on.

# Running from a battery
- Deep sleep
- Power LED

# What's next?
- Dynamic WiFi setup
- Dynamic Ubidots variable setup based on Chip ID
- Implement additional hardware functions:
  * connect a second sensor, e.g. for humidity or light
  * add relay switch and control it through Ubidots
  * replace Ubidots with some other (maybe custom) platform
