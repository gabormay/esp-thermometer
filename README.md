The objective of this project is to create a really inexpensive internet enabled thermometer to be able to monitor a room's temperature remotely.

# Main components
Here what you're going to need to build the project:
- ESP-01, a ESP8266 chip based WiFi module (others may also work with some modifications)
- DS18S20 digital thermometer chip
- FTDI or USB-to-Serial (3v3!) adapter (for programming the ESP8266)
- some cables, and a few discrete components (see the schematic)

# Software
